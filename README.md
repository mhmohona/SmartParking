# SmartParking

We want to build an mobile application that will solve parking problem in cities. In the app there will be two types of registration, one is for those people who want to put their space on rent and other type of registration will be for vehicle owners. Firstly, the space owner can register their free parking space on rent. App will show whether the  space will free for rent or not and also location. secondly, vehicle owners can use that space for parking that space. Vehicle owner can contact with the space owner and ask them for rent. When the vehicle owner will go a specific place, he will search for nearby parking spaces on the application. The app will then use Artificial Intelligence and machine learning to suggest the user for the best possible and available parking space nearby.
